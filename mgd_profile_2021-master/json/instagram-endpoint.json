In fact, any preparation would have been good. \n\nI had figured I'd just \"wing it\" since we were so busy preparing a new #performance, and that was a priority. In my mind, I wanted to be \"#authentic\" and to really show what 10 minutes of starting from scratch looked like. What's the worst that could happen?\n\nSo that 10 minutes went by pretty damn fast, and it didn't turn out great. Afterwards, it was hard to swallow. It didn't help that the stream has been seen by over 10 000 people.\n\nI felt genuinely bad about it for a while. Just silly and mostly embarrassed. Eventually, I came around to being glad I put myself out there and had the courage to try this. Strangely, I think the experience actually gave me a bit more confidence in the end, to just go for it and put yourself on the line, even if it‚Äôs only to learn a lesson.\n\nSince then, I have come to love sharing #behindthescenes and demystifying #creative processes. I absolutely love #teaching and giving #workshops, as well as working with students to help them advance their #practice. I now teach how you can be authentic, in-the-moment AND prepared - like good #jazz musicians! üòÜ\n\nSo no regrets.

I wanted to share some photos from that very first show, before the work had really matured.\n\nThis first version was basically a prototype, but it was so necessary to bring the work into reality. We had created it during a residency at @pertedesignal during the weeks before. The premiere had a lot of issues, but what we learned was substantial. We were able to improve the result dramatically over the next year of presentations. \n\nSince the premiere, we've shown \"Membrane\" in many different countries, sometimes with multiple trips to each location. This process of constant refinement over several years really changed the way I view making an #artwork, or really any project in general. It's just never really finished, and that's just part of the process. The important thing is to get it out there, and to realize perfecting it will happen over time.\n\nIt's frightening to present new work.

This came from obsession with the \"post-digital\", or #glitch, aesthetic defined by labels like @12k_label, @rastermedia and Line.\n\nA new performance titled ‚ÄúSkeletal Wires\" was the result, and premiered at @mutekmontreal 2015. It was the first time collaborating with MontreÃÅal's @diagraf, a #visual #artist known for his impressive #minimalist designs. We would later produce performances and film for planetariums, together with programmer/artist @ewerx.\n\nüìΩ Visuals by @diagraf \nüì∏ Photos by @carolinehayeur @cassandra.sswell\n\nüéß #listen\nhttps://soundcloud.com/mutek_montreal/muteklive104-wiklow-pres-skeletal-wires\n\n#postdigital #performance #musicperformance #montreal #canadamusic #turntables #djing #audiovisual¬†#soundproduction¬†#analogsynth¬†#beats¬†#makemusic¬†#composer¬†#composition¬†#drums¬†#performanceart #art #vinyl","timestamp":"2021-05-13T14:26:11+0000","children":{"data":[{"media_url":"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/184838296_2982479902021862_2258097951603966444_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=2MR_VJdyX6wAX8esK2F&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANo9K5cEAAAA&oh=00_AT8XzWIeKt0ngSSzt1O8Py0eowFY8IwMbX0GYmj7_3chtA&oe=6212B0D2","id":"17869785896383097"},{"media_url":"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/184850777_1887590918060555_8891603444566590476_n.jpg?_nc_cat=104&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=SNMB1yH3H_MAX-4KVmr&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANo9K5cEAAAA&oh=00_AT85Zi287LpCkdWd-feR1c7SGiqUX2kGw3qJKz0sPIqIeQ&oe=6213AE9F","id":"17885089694288621"},{"media_url":"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/185931880_470574860864619_2244232852176285390_n.jpg?_nc_cat=102&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=_cxXhAi2cSQAX_n5yAn&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANo9K5cEAAAA&oh=00_AT9356O3UDyoerblSiSyz3NhtkKLMeQHla2DtZVyKSZ22A&oe=62142DA5","id":"17898678286997933"},{"media_url":"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/184878426_2917640438522056_8852631723610720334_n.jpg?_nc_cat=108&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=RbiVCESEUJEAX840nn_&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANo9K5cEAAAA&oh=00_AT8iFNPyU6awoESOsfTyWP6ti_ElGnO42sKanI38ZRPrbA&oe=6213CD63","id":"17890287935131174"},{"media_url":"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/185243419_992769328201989_7918794265568461188_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=1P9LWnJ2aoUAX9f1uPP&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANo9K5cEAAAA&oh=00_AT-elxG3iq-qj0FeN3LnS5udougmEdWq09RZu_5CM9TwjA&oe=6212BBB7","id":"17945647447444722"}]}},{"id":"17873152823393626","media_type":"VIDEO","permalink":"https://www.instagram.com/p/COtIHmZh_At/","media_url":"https://video.cdninstagram.com/v/t50.2886-16/185012509_914404362729372_3778958006256566596_n.mp4?_nc_cat=100&vs=17881916489323757_3876700836&_nc_vs=HBksFQAYJEdCMFJCd3VjdHpoYnBUOERBRVNCQ3ZCSWpuRTBia1lMQUFBRhUAAsgBABUAGCRHRkR5Q0F2Vml1dlA5WUVCQUFHbnV5TFNvM1JTYmtZTEFBQUYVAgLIAQAoABgAGwGIB3VzZV9vaWwBMRUAACbaqZSuw%2BDDPxUCKAJDMywXQEBmZmZmZmYYEmRhc2hfYmFzZWxpbmVfMV92MREAdeoHAA%3D%3D&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=59939d&efg=eyJ2ZW5jb2RlX3RhZyI6InZ0c192b2RfdXJsZ2VuLjcyMC5mZWVkIn0%3D&_nc_ohc=kZnbCmYcitIAX9pN5-y&_nc_ht=video.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANo9K5cEAAAA&oh=00_AT-d59E6XtWZaTHVsS5UWA3fmijWy4xmf5hejp2At-WAwA&oe=620F0ED7&_nc_rid=8936a51e95","thumbnail_url":"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/v/t51.29350-15/183563561_553557979366048_6635249469960692319_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-5&_nc_sid=8ae9d6&_nc_ohc=PX8vnffDjSYAX9P3Oxa&_nc_ht=scontent.cdninstagram.com&edm=ANo9K5cEAAAA&oh=00_AT9sZNKnM41bvPj68nb7fcC9iHADtaAWIrxftL2eNNdlOA&oe=6213CAF6","username":"michaelgarydean","caption":"A little solo sunset session.
